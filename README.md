Haunted House

***All the info you need to know for the game is on the menu when you run the game.

  **Main code is at the bottom after you scroll past the many dimensional arrays.
  The arrays are used as database for the game content.

Haunted House is a game inspired by the interactive fiction game on Playfic I loved creating, with my friends, when I was in grade 9.

When I came back, to look back on it after a few years had passed, it made me sad to find that my game had developed a few bugs and that 1000+ people had played it. 
I decided to remake it as a project for python and 2D dictionaries.
