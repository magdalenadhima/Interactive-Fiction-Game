Haunted House

Haunted House is a game inspired by the interactive fiction game on Playfic I loved creating when I was in grade 9, with my friends.

After coming back to it a few years later, it made me sad to find that my game had developed a few bugs and that 1000+ people had played it. 
I decided to remake it as a project for python and 2D dictionaries.

*All the info you need to know for the game is on the menu when you run the game.
